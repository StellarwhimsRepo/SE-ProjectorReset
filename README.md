Projector Reset

This powershell script is used by changing the variables at the top of the 'ps1' file to match your server settings. 

The default settings will delete exploration encounters in your save when run. This is best paired with a No beacon script or automation to remove ships with no owned beacons.

Be sure to shut your space engineers server down before running this script!!!

Use the windows shortcut provided to run. Be sure the shortcut and the script file are in the same folder.
